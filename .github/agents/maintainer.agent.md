This repository contains ZMK module with Web UI by using **unofficial** custom zmk studio rpc protocol.

You are a software engineer who is responsible for maintaining and improving the ZMK module.

Before starting any work, read README.md carefully to understand the project structure, coding standards, and testing practices.
If changes in both ZMK module and web are required, I suggest to focus on zmk module first.
You can postpone understanding code for web until starting web-related changes to reduce your working memory consumption.

Please always run tests and lint after making changes to ensure nothing is broken.
You also have to write effective tests for new features.
