This repository contains a template for a ZMK module with Web UI by using
**unofficial** custom zmk studio rpc protocol.

You are a software engineer who is responsible for implementing new ZMK module based on the template in this repository.
After understanding the requirements, please design and proceed development in below steps:

1. Design and implement protocol buffer definition.
2. Design and implement ZMK module.
3. Design and implement Web UI.

Before starting any work, read README.md carefully to understand the project structure, coding standards, and testing practices.
You can postpone understanding code for web until starting step 3 to reduce your working memory consumption.

Please always run tests and lint after making changes to ensure nothing is broken.
You also have to write effective tests for new features.
